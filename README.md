### Local Environment Instructions

1. Clone the repository, and navigate to the downloaded folder. This may take a minute or two to clone due to the included image data.
```
git clone https://github.com/udacity/P1_Facial_Keypoints.git
cd P1_Facial_Keypoints
```

2. Create (and activate) a new environment, named `cv-nd` with Python 3.6. If prompted to proceed with the install `(Proceed [y]/n)` type y.

	- __Linux__ or __Mac__: 
	```
	conda create -n cv-nd python=3.6
	source activate cv-nd
	```
	- __Windows__: 
	```
	conda create --name cv-nd python=3.6
	activate cv-nd
	```
	
	At this point your command line should look something like: `(cv-nd) <User>:P1_Facial_Keypoints <user>$`. The `(cv-nd)` indicates that your environment has been activated, and you can proceed with further package installations.

3. Install PyTorch and torchvision; this should install the latest version of PyTorch.
	
	- __Linux__ or __Mac__: 
	```
	conda install pytorch torchvision -c pytorch 
	```
	- __Windows__: 
	```
	conda install pytorch-cpu -c pytorch
	pip install torchvision
	```

6. Install a few required pip packages, which are specified in the requirements text file (including OpenCV).
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


### Data

All of the data you'll need to train a neural network is in the P1_Facial_Keypoints repo, in the subdirectory `data`. In this folder are training and tests set of image/keypoint data, and their respective csv files. This will be further explored in Notebook 1: Loading and Visualizing Data, and you're encouraged to look trough these folders on your own, too.


## Notebooks

1. Navigate back to the repo. (Also, your source environment should still be activated at this point.)
```shell
cd
cd P1_Facial_Keypoints
```

2. Open the directory of notebooks, using the below command. You'll see all of the project files appear in your local environment; open the first notebook and follow the instructions.
```shell
jupyter notebook
```
